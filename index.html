			<h1>About</h1>

			<p><span>Gon is the son of Ging Freecss, a legendary hunter who was never around when Gon was little, as he was always out on adventures. Due to this, Gon decided that he would become a Hunter himself. When he was ready, Gon set out to take the Hunter Exam. During the Exam, Gon met three people who would become his best friends, Killua Zoldyck, a boy Gon's age from a family of assassins, Leorio Paradinight, a man who wished to become a Hunter to earn money and become a doctor, and Kurapika, a boy who wanted to hunt down a group of thieves that wiped out his whole clan except for him.</span></p>
